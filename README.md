To guarantee the safety of people and in order to stop the COVID-19 spread ,we need to limit these movements in a  controlled and managed  fashion in order to avoid  unnecessary social contact and also to track and monitor infected citizens and potential threats . Our solution solves this very problem. In fact,we ,as active members of IEEE INSAT, suggest a project that helps manage the distribution of people who are in need to leave their premises through a platform that serves as a medium for controlling this movement using a gps tracking bracelet in a simple, intelligent and  efficient way .  Our project contains two main  components  the platform and the electronic gps bracelet
